## Bus-Mall

I have greated a website to find out what is the greatest invention in the whole world. I have compiled the top 25 inventions and will use this site to narrow it down. The site will show the inventions 3 at a time, allowing the user to vote on their favorite. By the end i should have a bar graph that definitively shows what the best inventions ever created is.

### Reflections and Comments

This was definitely the most comprehensive project I have done. I really enjoyed the backend work, and the storing of data.
